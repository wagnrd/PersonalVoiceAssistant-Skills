     * act like wildcards for an arbitrary string. The intent acts like an identifier to know which type of
     * utterance this is. The intent should differ for every set of different entities used in an utterance.
     *
     * Example:
     *      1. Utterance: "How it the weather in @city?" - Intent: weather_city_intent
     *      2. Utterance: "Whats the weather in @city?" - Intent: weather_city_intent

     *
     * The entities don't have to be in the same order for the same intent if there are more than one in an utterance.
     * When you receive them in the "process" function the map will contain the intent-names and their corresponding
     * value. So you don't have to mind the ordering.
     *
     * This is basically some sort of application for the position of the next active skill from which the
     * SkillManager will choose.
     *
     * @return The current map of supported utterances (key) and intents (value).
